### Instructions

1.  **Combine Ingredients:** Put the 50g of hop pellets into the clean glass jar. Pour the 100ml of Everclear over the pellets, making sure they're fully submerged.
2.  **Infuse:** Seal the jar tightly. Store it in a cool, dark place for 1 to 2 weeks. Give the jar a good shake once or twice a day to help with extraction.
3.  **Strain:** After infusion, pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl to remove the large hop solids. Gently press on the solids to get out more liquid.
4.  **Filter:** Line the strainer with a coffee filter (or several layers of cheesecloth) and place it over another clean bowl. Slowly pour the strained liquid through this filter to remove any fine particles. This step makes your tincture clear.
5.  **Store:** Transfer the clear hop extract into your dark glass storage bottle and seal it well. Keep it in a cool, dark place, like your refrigerator, to maintain its potency.
