## Brewing Process (1 gallon)

### Step 1: Caramelize Honey *(Bochet Method)*

- Caramelize **1.25 lb (20 oz)** wildflower honey in a saucepan on medium heat (~30–45 min), stirring constantly until dark amber-to-brown.
- Cool slightly (~150°F), carefully add warm water to thin.
- Combine caramelized honey and buckwheat honey in fermenter. Ensure temp ~65–70°F.
- Add Molasses

### Step 2: Hop Tea *(Bitterness & Flavor)*

- Boil **1–2 cups water**, add bittering hops (**~0.1 oz Simcoe/Centennial**); boil 15 min.
- Remove heat; add aroma hops (**~0.2 oz Citra**); steep 15–20 min.
- Strain hop tea into fermenter.
- Add Water to 1 gal, add additional Buckwheat honey as needed to reach ~1.060–1.065 OG

### Step 3: Yeast Pitching & Primary Fermentation

- Aerate must vigorously.
- Pitch yeast (rehydrated according to instructions).
- Add first nutrient addition (**⅛ tsp**).
- Seal fermenter with airlock.

### Step 4: Fermentation Management *(SNA & Degassing)*

- Staggered Nutrient Additions (⅛ tsp each):

| Timing                   | Addition          |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Yeast pitch              | ⅛ tsp             |
| After 24 hours           | ⅛ tsp             |
| After 48 hours           | ⅛ tsp             |
| At 1/3 sugar break (~1.040)| ⅛ tsp             |

- Gently degas 1–2 times daily for first 3–4 days.
- Ferment ~2 weeks at 65–70°F until gravity ~0.998–1.000.

### Step 5: Dry Hopping & Spices

- Rack to Secondary
- Add **~1.0 oz (28 grams)** course ground coffee beans, Steep for 48-72 hours
- Add **~1.0 oz (28 grams)** cacao nibs, steep for 1-2 weeks
- Add **1 bean** vanilla, scraped
- Add **~0.5 oz (14 grams)** dry hops (Citra/Mosaic) once fermentation is nearly complete (gravity ≤1.005).
- Dry hop for **3–5 days** at room temp (~65–70°F).
- *(Optional)* Cold crash (**32–40°F**) 24–48 hrs before bottling.

### Step 6: Priming and Bottling

- Rack mead into bottling bucket; add priming sugar (**~1 oz sugar** dissolved in **¼ cup boiled/cooled water**).
- Gently stir; bottle into sanitized sturdy bottles suitable for carbonation.

- Place honey in mason jar (lid off, jar half-full).
- Pressure cook on high for ~45–60 min; naturally release.
- Repeat if darker caramelization desired.

### Adjusting Bitterness & Hops:

- **Lower bitterness**: reduce or skip bittering hops.
- **Increase hop aroma**: slightly increase dry-hop amount.

### Avoiding Sweetness:

- Ensure full dryness before bottling (gravity ~1.000 or lower).
