# Buckwheat Honey Mead Recipe

This recipe yields a dry, effervescent mead with a unique character from buckwheat and caramelized honey, balanced by a hint of citrus. This recipe is scaled for a 1-gallon batch.

### Ingredients:

* **Honey:**
    * 11.5 Fl Ounces Buckwheat Honey
    * Small amount of Caramelized Honey (for flavor depth - e.g., 0.1-0.2 lbs for 1 gallon)
* **Yeast:** (Not specified, but essential for fermentation - e.g., Lalvin EC-1118, D47, or similar wine/mead yeast)
* **Nutrients:** (Not specified, but highly recommended for mead fermentation - e.g., Fermaid O, Fermaid K, DAP)
* **Flavoring:**
    * 15ml Citra Extract (added post-fermentation)
* **Priming Sugar (for bottle conditioning):**
    * 44.7g Blackstrap Molasses (for 1 gallon, yielding approx. 25g sugars for carbonation - Note: This amount of molasses may provide a higher carbonation level for 1 gallon than typical. Adjust based on desired fizziness.)
* **Water:** (Good quality, dechlorinated water)

### Equipment:

* Primary Fermentor (e.g., 1-gallon carboy or bucket)
* Airlock and Stopper
* Hydrometer and Test Jar
* Sanitizer
* Bottles, Caps, and Capper (if bottle conditioning)
* Measuring spoons/syringes for extract
* Scale for molasses

### Instructions:

1.  **Sanitization:** Thoroughly clean and sanitize all brewing equipment that will come into contact with the must (the unfermented honey mixture).
2.  **Prepare Honey:**
    * In a large pot, gently warm a portion of your water (do not boil) and dissolve the 11.5 Fl Ounces of buckwheat honey.
    * Add the small amount of caramelized honey and stir until fully dissolved.
    * Top up with cold water to reach a total volume of 1 gallon.
3.  **Measure Original Gravity (OG):** Once the must is at room temperature (65&ndash;75&deg;F/18&ndash;24&deg;C), take a sample and measure the Original Gravity using your hydrometer. Adjust with more honey or water if needed to reach an OG of 1.038.
4.  **Pitch Yeast:** Rehydrate your chosen yeast according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once rehydrated, pitch the yeast into the fermentor.
5.  **Add Nutrients (Optional but Recommended):** If using, add yeast nutrients according to their instructions over the first few days of fermentation.
6.  **Fermentation:** Seal the fermentor with an airlock. Ferment in a cool, dark place (60&ndash;70&deg;F/15&ndash;21&deg;C) until fermentation is complete. This typically takes 2-4 weeks, or until the hydrometer reading stabilizes at 1.000 for several days.
7.  **Measure Final Gravity (FG):** Once fermentation is complete, take a final hydrometer reading to confirm the Final Gravity is 1.000.
8.  **Add Citra Extract:** Carefully rack the mead off the yeast cake into a clean, sanitized secondary fermentor or bottling bucket. Stir in the 15ml Citra extract gently to combine.
9.  **Prepare for Bottling (Bottle Conditioning):**
    * In a small saucepan, dissolve 44.7g of blackstrap molasses in a small amount of warm water (e.g., 1/4 cup). Bring to a gentle simmer for 5 minutes, then let cool completely.
    * Gently add the cooled molasses solution to the mead in the bottling bucket, stirring carefully to ensure even distribution without aerating the mead too much.
10. **Bottle:** Fill sanitized bottles, leaving about 1 inch of headspace. Cap securely.
11. **Bottle Conditioning:** Store bottles in a warm, dark place (70&ndash;75&deg;F/21&ndash;24&deg;C) for 1-2 weeks to allow for carbonation.
12. **Chill and Enjoy:** Once carbonated, chill the bottles thoroughly before serving.

### Notes:

* **ABV Calculation:** With an OG of 1.038 and FG of 1.000, your mead will be approximately 5% ABV.
* **Sweetness:** This recipe will produce a very dry mead. If you prefer a sweeter mead, you would need to stabilize the mead after fermentation and then backsweeten with additional honey.
* **Aging:** While drinkable young, mead often improves with age. Store bottles in a cool, dark place for several months to a year for enhanced flavor development.
