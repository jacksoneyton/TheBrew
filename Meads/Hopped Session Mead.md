# Buckwheat Honey Mead Recipe

This recipe yields a dry, effervescent mead with a unique character from buckwheat and caramelized honey, balanced by a hint of citrus. This recipe is scaled for a 1-gallon batch.

### Ingredients:

* **Honey:**
    * 11.5 Fl Ounces Buckwheat Honey
* **Yeast:** SA-04
* **Nutrients:** [SNA](https://frugalhomebrew.com/easy-guide-for-mead-nutrient-additions-what-is-staggering/#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20nutrient%20staggering%20is%20to%20take,want%20to%20stagger%20with%20are%20Fermaid-K%20or%20DAP.)
* **Flavoring:**
    * 15ml Citra Extract (added post-fermentation)
* **Priming Sugar (for bottle conditioning):**
    * 44.7g Blackstrap Molasses (for 1 gallon, yielding approx. 25g sugars for carbonation.)
* **Water:** (Good quality, dechlorinated water)

### Equipment:

* Primary Fermentor (e.g., 1-gallon carboy or bucket)
* Airlock and Stopper
* Hydrometer and Test Jar
* Sanitizer
* Bottles, Caps, and Capper (if bottle conditioning) _or fliptop bottles_
* Measuring spoons/syringes for extract
* Scale for molasses

### Instructions:

1.  **Sanitization:** Thoroughly clean and sanitize all brewing equipment that will come into contact with the must (the unfermented honey mixture).
2.  **Prepare Honey:**
    * In a large pot, gently warm a portion of your water (do not boil) and dissolve the 11.5 Fl Ounces of buckwheat honey.
    * Top up with cold water to reach a total volume of 1 gallon.
3.  **Measure Original Gravity (OG):** Once the must is at room temperature (65&ndash;75&deg;F/18&ndash;24&deg;C), take a sample and measure the Original Gravity using your hydrometer. Adjust with more honey or water if needed to reach an OG of 1.038.
4.  **Pitch Yeast:** pitch the yeast into the fermentor.
**Add Nutrients (Staggered Nutrient Additions - SNA):** Implement a staggered nutrient addition (SNA) schedule. A common approach for 1 gallon is to add your chosen yeast nutrients (e.g., Fermaid O, Fermaid K, DAP) in 3-4 equal doses: _the below are ideal steps, but we dont need to over think this. Use the nutrient instructions of choice, divide the amount equally over 3-4 days. Degass before each addition, the oxygen addition is really the key to helping the yeast reproduce_
    * **24 hours after pitching yeast**
    * **At 1/3 sugar break** (when the specific gravity has dropped by 1/3 of the initial sugar content - e.g., if OG was 1.038, 1/3 break is around 1.025)
    * **Optionally, another dose at 2/3 sugar break** or half of the 1/3 sugar break dose.
    * Always degas your mead gently before adding nutrients to prevent foam-overs.
6.  **Fermentation:** Seal the fermentor with an airlock. Ferment in a cool, dark place (60&ndash;70&deg;F/15&ndash;21&deg;C) until fermentation is complete. This typically takes 2-4 weeks, or until the hydrometer reading stabilizes at 1.000 for several days.
7.  **Measure Final Gravity (FG):** Once fermentation is complete, take a final hydrometer reading to confirm the Final Gravity is 1.000.
8.  **Add Citra Extract:** Carefully rack the mead off the yeast cake into a clean, sanitized secondary fermentor or bottling bucket. Stir in the hop extract to desired taste, amounts will vary depending on the extract.
9.  **Prepare for Bottling (Bottle Conditioning):**
    * In a small saucepan, dissolve 44.7g of blackstrap molasses in a small amount of warm water (e.g., 1/4 cup). Bring to a gentle simmer for 5 minutes, then let cool completely.
    * Gently add the cooled molasses solution to the mead in the bottling bucket, stirring carefully to ensure even distribution without aerating the mead too much.
10. **Bottle:** Fill sanitized bottles, leaving about 1 inch of headspace. Cap securely.
11. **Bottle Conditioning:** Store bottles in a warm, dark place (70&ndash;75&deg;F/21&ndash;24&deg;C) for 1-2 weeks to allow for carbonation.
12. **Chill and Enjoy:** Once carbonated, chill the bottles thoroughly before serving.

### Notes:

* **ABV Calculation:** With an OG of 1.038 and FG of 1.000, your mead will be approximately 5% ABV.
* **Sweetness:** This recipe will produce a very dry mead. If you prefer a sweeter mead, you would need to stabilize the mead after fermentation and then backsweeten with additional honey.
